      Why the BA Scheme in Design
    </h2>
    <p class="body-text">I am applying to the BA Scheme in Design at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University because of its strong emphasis on design fundamentals, cross-disciplinary exploration, and reflective practice. While my current work is centered on interactive and game-based projects, I see these projects primarily as a way to explore broader design questions such as interaction, structure, clarity, and user experience.</p>
    <p class="body-text">I am particularly drawn to the scheme-based structure because it allows students to develop a solid design foundation before specializing. I hope to use this environment to strengthen my design thinking, expand my understanding of design beyond a single medium, and learn how to communicate ideas through structured, user-centered processes.</p>

      Portfolio as Design Practice
    </h2>
    <p class="body-text">My portfolio presents a series of design studies rather than finished products. Each project uses games and interactive systems as a medium to examine how users perceive, understand, and engage with designed systems.</p>

    <h3 class="subsection-title">2D Platformer Adventure</h3>
    <p class="body-text">This project focuses on interaction design and user experience. Through iterative tuning of movement, camera behavior, and level structure, I explored how design decisions affect clarity, responsiveness, and player learning. The project reflects an emphasis on teaching through interaction rather than instruction, a principle that extends beyond games into general interaction design.</p>

    <h3 class="subsection-title">Procedural Generation Maze</h3>
    <p class="body-text">This project examines spatial structure and readability. By observing player navigation behavior, I studied how layout variation, landmarks, and repetition influence orientation and confusion. These insights connect directly to foundational design concerns such as visual hierarchy, spatial organization, and guiding users through complex systems.</p>

    <h3 class="subsection-title">Machine Learning Connect 4</h3>
    <p class="body-text">Although technically motivated, this project ultimately became a study of user perception and fairness. By comparing different decision-making systems, I explored how predictability, imperfection, and feedback shape user trust and engagement—an insight that is relevant to many areas of interaction and experience design.</p>

    <p class="body-text">Together, these projects demonstrate how I use making as a way to think through design problems and reflect on user experience.</p>

      Design Direction within the Scheme
    </h2>
    <p class="body-text">At this stage, I do not see my practice as fixed to a single design discipline. While I am currently drawn to interactive and game-based work, I am interested in how these skills transfer to interaction design, UI/UX, and experience-focused design more broadly.</p>
    <p class="body-text">Through the BA Scheme in Design, I hope to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Build stronger foundations in design theory and visual communication</li>
      <li>Learn structured methods for critique, iteration, and documentation</li>
      <li>Explore multiple design pathways before committing to a specialization</li>
      <li>Develop the ability to articulate design intent clearly and critically</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="body-text">I believe the scheme's emphasis on fundamentals and exploration will help me transform intuitive design decisions into a more rigorous and adaptable design practice.</p>

      Closing Intent
    </h2>
    <p class="body-text">I am applying to the BA Scheme in Design as a motivated learner with a clear interest in design thinking, not as a finished designer. My portfolio reflects curiosity, reflection, and a willingness to iterate based on user experience. I hope to further develop these qualities at PolyU, learning how to approach design problems with greater clarity, structure, and confidence across disciplines.</p>
