      Why BA Creative Media at CityU
    </h2>
    <p class="body-text">I am applying to the BA Creative Media programme at City University of Hong Kong because of its interdisciplinary approach that integrates computation, creative practice, and critical thinking. My background in computer science has given me strong technical foundations, but my creative work reflects a growing interest in how systems, algorithms, and rules shape human behavior and experience.</p>
    <p class="body-text">I am particularly drawn to Creative Media's emphasis on experimentation across digital media, where technology is treated not only as a tool for production but as a medium for inquiry. This aligns with how I currently use interactive systems and games as platforms for exploring ideas rather than as purely entertainment products.</p>

      Portfolio as Systemic Exploration
    </h2>
    <p class="body-text">My portfolio consists of interactive projects that investigate how rules, structures, and computational systems influence perception, decision-making, and engagement.</p>

    <h3 class="subsection-title">Machine Learning Connect 4</h3>
    <p class="body-text">This project explores how different AI decision-making models affect player experience. By comparing Minimax and NEAT-based opponents, I studied how optimal versus imperfect systems change perceived fairness, tension, and emotional response. The project reflects my interest in using computational methods as creative variables rather than fixed solutions.</p>

    <h3 class="subsection-title">Procedural Generation Maze</h3>
    <p class="body-text">This project examines procedural systems and spatial logic. Through algorithmic maze generation, I explored how randomness, repetition, and variation influence navigation and spatial understanding. Observing player behavior allowed me to reflect on how algorithmic structure translates into human experience.</p>

    <h3 class="subsection-title">2D Platformer Adventure</h3>
    <p class="body-text">While visually simple, this project functions as a study of interaction systems. Movement physics, camera behavior, and combat rules were treated as interconnected variables that shape player expression. The focus was not on realism or spectacle, but on how computational parameters affect "game feel" and embodied interaction.</p>

    <p class="body-text">Together, these works demonstrate my interest in creative computation, where code, systems, and rules become expressive media.</p>

      Creative Direction & Interdisciplinary Growth
    </h2>
    <p class="body-text">I am interested in creative media not as a single discipline, but as a space where technology, design, and artistic intent intersect. While games are currently my primary medium, I am eager to expand into broader forms of digital media, including interactive installations, experimental interfaces, and system-driven artworks.</p>
    <p class="body-text">Through the BA Creative Media programme, I hope to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Explore creative applications of algorithms and systems</li>
      <li>Develop conceptual frameworks for media-based experimentation</li>
      <li>Learn how to situate interactive work within cultural and critical contexts</li>
      <li>Collaborate with peers from diverse creative and technical backgrounds</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="body-text">CityU's focus on experimentation and research-informed practice strongly aligns with my desire to move beyond functional projects toward more exploratory and concept-driven work.</p>

      Closing Intent
    </h2>
    <p class="body-text">I am applying to BA Creative Media as a student who is still actively forming my creative identity. My portfolio reflects curiosity, experimentation, and a willingness to question how systems shape experience. I see CityU as an environment where I can deepen my critical understanding of media while continuing to explore computation as a creative language. I am motivated to learn, experiment, and contribute to a culture of interdisciplinary inquiry.</p>
