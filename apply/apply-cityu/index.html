      Why BA Creative Media at CityU
    </h2>
    <p class="body-text">I am applying to the BA Creative Media programme at City University of Hong Kong because I see games and interactive systems not merely as entertainment products, but as creative media that communicate ideas, emotions, and structures through player experience.</p>
    <p class="body-text">My background in computer science has given me a strong technical foundation, but my primary interest lies in how interaction, feedback, and choice shape meaning. Rather than using technology purely as a tool for production, I approach computation as a creative medium—one that allows systems, rules, and algorithms to become expressive elements within a work.</p>
    <p class="body-text">CityU's BA Creative Media programme strongly resonates with this approach. Its emphasis on interdisciplinary experimentation, creative computation, and research-informed practice aligns with how I currently work and how I hope to grow as a creative practitioner.</p>

      Portfolio as Systemic Exploration
    </h2>
    <p class="body-text">My portfolio centers on interactive works that explore how player experience is shaped through movement, feedback, and systemic design. While games are my primary medium, I use them to study how rules and algorithms translate into perception, emotion, and meaning.</p>

    <h3 class="subsection-title">2D Platformer Adventure</h3>
    <p class="body-text">Despite its visual simplicity, this project functions as a study of embodied interaction and game feel. Movement physics, camera behavior, enemy behavior, and combat rules were treated as interconnected systems that shape player expression.</p>
    <p class="body-text">I focused on how players learn through interaction rather than instruction. Level design, enemy placement, and feedback were structured to guide understanding organically, allowing curiosity and experimentation to drive engagement. This project reflects my belief that meaning in interactive media emerges through doing rather than explanation.</p>

    <h3 class="subsection-title">Machine Learning Connect 4</h3>
    <p class="body-text">In this project, I explored how different AI decision-making systems affect player psychology and emotional response. By comparing Minimax-based AI with a NEAT-trained neural network, I studied how optimal versus imperfect systems change perceived fairness, tension, and agency.</p>
    <p class="body-text">Rather than treating AI as a purely technical system, I approached it as a creative agent within the game. This allowed me to see machine learning as a medium that shapes experience rather than a background algorithm.</p>

    <h3 class="subsection-title">Procedural Generation Maze</h3>
    <p class="body-text">This project examines how procedural systems and spatial logic influence navigation and spatial understanding. Through algorithmic maze generation, I explored how randomness, repetition, and variation affect players' ability to form mental maps and make decisions under uncertainty.</p>
    <p class="body-text">By observing player behavior, I reflected on how abstract computational structures translate into lived spatial experience.</p>

      Creative Direction & Interdisciplinary Growth
    </h2>
    <p class="body-text">I am interested in creative media as a space where technology, design, and artistic intent intersect. While games are currently my primary medium, I do not see them as an endpoint. I am eager to explore broader forms of creative media, including interactive installations, experimental interfaces, and system-driven artworks.</p>
    <p class="body-text">Through the BA Creative Media programme, I hope to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Explore algorithms and systems as creative materials</li>
      <li>Develop conceptual frameworks for media-based experimentation</li>
      <li>Learn how to situate interactive work within cultural and critical contexts</li>
      <li>Collaborate with peers from diverse creative and technical backgrounds</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="body-text">CityU's emphasis on experimentation and interdisciplinary inquiry offers an environment where I can move beyond functional projects toward more exploratory, concept-driven work.</p>

      Closing Intent
    </h2>
    <p class="body-text">I am applying to BA Creative Media as a student who is still actively forming my creative identity. My portfolio reflects curiosity, experimentation, and a willingness to question how systems shape experience.</p>
    <p class="body-text">I see CityU as a space where I can deepen my critical understanding of media while continuing to develop computation as a creative language. I am motivated to learn, experiment, and contribute to a culture of interdisciplinary exploration within the School of Creative Media.</p>
