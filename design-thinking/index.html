      This page collects short reflections on how I approach game design as a solo developer. Rather than focusing on visual polish, I prioritize clarity of mechanics, player feedback, and iterative improvement through playtesting.

      <h3>Context-Based Combat</h3>

      <p class="placeholder-text"><strong>Context:</strong> Traditional action games use multiple buttons for different attacks, increasing complexity and cognitive load for players.</p>

      <p class="placeholder-text"><strong>Decision:</strong> I implemented a single attack input that varies based on player state (airborne, standing, moving), creating different attacks from one button.</p>

      <p class="placeholder-text"><strong>Result:</strong> Players could focus on positioning and timing rather than memorizing button combinations, while still experiencing combat depth through emergent move combinations.</p>

      <p class="placeholder-text"><strong>Insight:</strong> Simplicity in input controls can create depth through contextual variation. Less is often more when it comes to control schemes.</p>

    <div class="reflection-section">
      <h3>Physics Tuning by Feel</h3>

      <p class="placeholder-text"><strong>Context:</strong> Jump mechanics needed to feel satisfying and responsive, not just function correctly from a physics standpoint.</p>

      <p class="placeholder-text"><strong>Decision:</strong> Rather than using mathematically "correct" physics values, I spent extensive time playtesting and tweaking gravity, jump height, and air control based purely on how it felt.</p>

      <p class="placeholder-text"><strong>Result:</strong> Movement feels tight and enjoyable. Players have precise control, and jumps feel predictable yet dynamic. Hundreds of small adjustments transformed functional movement into fun movement.</p>

      <p class="placeholder-text"><strong>Insight:</strong> The difference between functional and enjoyable often lies in fine-tuning through iteration. Feel trumps mathematical accuracy in game design.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="reflection-section">
      <h3>Camera System Evolution</h3>

      <p class="placeholder-text"><strong>Context:</strong> My initial simple follow camera felt jarring during jumps and rapid player movement, creating a disorienting experience.</p>

      <p class="placeholder-text"><strong>Decision:</strong> I refined the camera to anticipate player direction and smooth out rapid movements, looking slightly ahead in the direction of jumps and movement.</p>

      <p class="placeholder-text"><strong>Result:</strong> The viewing experience became more cinematic and comfortable. Players could see ahead to where they're going, reducing frustration and improving platforming precision.</p>

      <p class="placeholder-text"><strong>Insight:</strong> Good camera work is invisible—players notice when it's bad, not when it's good. The best camera systems serve the player without drawing attention to themselves.</p>
