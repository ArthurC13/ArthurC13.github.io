    </h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>I am an aspiring indie game developer with a background in computer science and a strong focus on gameplay design, systems, and iteration. Through personal game projects, I explore how mechanics, feedback, and constraints shape player experience. I am particularly interested in designing games that feel clear, responsive, and complete, even with limited visual resources.</p>

      <span>Academic & Technical Background</span>
    </h2>
    <p>I studied Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics at A-level, which gave me a strong analytical foundation and comfort with technical problem-solving. I later enrolled in a Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence program, where I further developed my programming skills and understanding of computational systems. This background continues to inform how I approach game development, especially in areas such as system design, logic, and iteration.</p>

      <span>Clarifying My Direction Through Making</span>
    </h2>
    <p>During my university studies, I realized that I was most motivated when building interactive projects rather than conducting theoretical or research-oriented work. While I value the rigor of computer science, I found that my interests aligned more closely with hands-on creation — designing, implementing, testing, and refining experiences that people could directly engage with.</p>
    <p>This realization led me to step away from my initial program and focus more intentionally on game creation and design. Rather than viewing this as a departure from my technical background, I see it as a clarification of direction: using programming as a tool to support design goals and player experience.</p>

      <span>Current Practice</span>
    </h2>
    <p>I currently focus on developing small, self-directed game projects, often working as a solo developer. My process emphasizes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Defining a clear core mechanic</li>
      <li>Prototyping quickly</li>
      <li>Iterating based on playtesting and observation</li>
      <li>Prioritizing clarity and responsiveness over visual complexity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As someone with limited formal art training, I am especially attentive to how timing, input response, sound, UI, and system feedback can communicate game state and intent. These constraints have shaped how I think about design decisions and scope control in indie development.</p>

      <span>Design Interests</span>
    </h2>
    <p>Through my projects, I am particularly interested in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Teaching mechanics organically through level and system design</li>
      <li>Designing player feedback without relying on high-fidelity visuals</li>
      <li>Balancing difficulty through systems rather than numerical tuning alone</li>
      <li>Managing scope and knowing when to stop adding features in order to finish projects</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These interests are explored further in my project pages and design reflections.</p>

      <span>What I Hope to Learn</span>
    </h2>
    <p>I am seeking formal education in game design to strengthen my design fundamentals, receive structured critique, and learn from peers with diverse creative backgrounds. I hope to deepen my understanding of design theory, iteration, and collaboration, while continuing to develop as a creator capable of bringing complete game experiences from concept to execution.</p>
