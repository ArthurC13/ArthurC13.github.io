    <!-- Short Overview -->
    <p class="project-overview">
      A fully playable 2D platformer developed initially as my Computer Science A-Level project and refined through continued iteration. This project explores core principles of platformer design, with a focus on responsive player movement, camera behavior, and level structures that introduce mechanics gradually while rewarding exploration and mastery.
    </p>

    <!-- Design Goal -->
    <h3 class="subsection-title">Design Goal</h3>
    <p>
      The primary design goal was to create a platformer where movement itself feels expressive and enjoyable. Rather than relying on explicit tutorials, I designed levels to teach mechanics organically through player interaction and experimentation. By encouraging discovery and repetition, the game allows players to develop genuine skill over time, making mastery feel earned rather than instructed.
    </p>

    <!-- Core Mechanics -->
    <h3 class="subsection-title">Core Mechanics</h3>
    <ul class="mechanics-list">
      <li>Responsive movement physics with precise jumping and air control</li>
      <li>A minimal-input combat system that supports expressive play</li>
      <li>A dynamic camera system that anticipates movement and smooths transitions</li>
      <li>Progressive level design that introduces mechanics incrementally</li>
      <li>Hidden collectibles and secret areas that reward exploration</li>
      <li>Interactive environmental elements and platforming challenges</li>
      <li>Clear animation and visual feedback for player actions</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Iteration & Design Process -->
    <h3 class="subsection-title">Iteration & Design Process</h3>
    <p>
      Development began with establishing the core movement system. I spent significant time tuning jump physics—adjusting gravity, jump height, and air control—until movement felt responsive and predictable. These decisions were guided primarily by play feel rather than realism, informed through repeated testing and adjustment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The camera system went through several iterations. An initial direct-follow camera felt disorienting during fast movement and jumps, so I introduced directional look-ahead and smoothing. This allowed players to better anticipate upcoming challenges while maintaining visual comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Level design evolved from simple linear layouts into stages with branching paths and optional challenges. Through playtesting with classmates and friends, I observed where difficulty felt unclear or unfair and adjusted pacing accordingly. This process reinforced the idea that effective level design is not about difficulty alone, but about teaching mechanics through spatial and environmental cues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Combat design was intentionally kept minimal. Instead of multiple attack buttons, I designed a single attack input that interacts with player movement and state. Different outcomes emerge depending on timing, positioning, and whether the player is grounded or airborne, allowing depth to arise from movement rather than complexity.
    </p>

    <!-- Reflection -->
    <h3 class="subsection-title">Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      This project taught me that game design is fundamentally an iterative, player-centered process. On a technical level, I gained experience with physics systems, camera behavior, and numerical tuning. More importantly, I learned how small adjustments—timing windows, animation feedback, and pacing—can dramatically change how a game feels to play.
    </p>
    <p>
     Looking back, I would prototype a wider range of mechanics earlier before committing to full implementation. I invested time in features that ultimately did not strengthen the core experience. Playtesting proved especially valuable; observing others play revealed usability and clarity issues I could not identify on my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important lesson was understanding the difference between making systems function and making them feel right. An enjoyable platformer is defined not by a single mechanic, but by the accumulation of countless small design decisions refined through testing. This project reshaped how I approach development, shifting my focus from implementation alone to experience-driven design.
