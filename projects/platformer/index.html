    <!-- Short Overview -->
    <p class="project-overview">
      A comprehensive 2D platformer game developed as my Computer Science A-Level project and continuously refined through iterative development. This project explores the fundamentals of platformer design, focusing on responsive player controls, dynamic camera systems, and progressive level design that gradually introduces mechanics while rewarding exploration and player mastery.
    </p>

    <!-- Design Goal -->
    <h3 class="subsection-title">Design Goal</h3>
    <p>
      My design vision was to create a platformer with fluid and responsive controls, where movement itself feels enjoyable and expressive. Rather than relying on explicit tutorials, the levels are designed to teach mechanics organically through player interaction and discovery. The goal was to create an experience that feels rewarding to master, allowing players to develop genuine skill through practice, experimentation, and exploration.
    </p>

    <!-- Core Mechanics -->
    <h3 class="subsection-title">Core Mechanics</h3>
    <ul class="mechanics-list">
      <li>Precise movement physics with responsive jumping and air control</li>
      <li>Dynamic camera system that smoothly follows player movement and anticipates jumps</li>
      <li>Progressive level design that introduces new mechanics gradually</li>
      <li>Hidden collectibles and secret areas that reward thorough exploration</li>
      <li>Interactive environmental objects and platforming challenges</li>
      <li>Smooth animations and visual feedback for player actions</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Iteration & Design Process -->
    <h3 class="subsection-title">Iteration & Design Process</h3>
    <p>
      Development began with establishing core movement mechanics. I spent significant time tuning jump physics—adjusting gravity, jump height, and air control until movement felt responsive and predictable. This involved extensive playtesting and tweaking values based on how the game actually felt to play, not just how it looked on paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The camera system went through multiple iterations. My initial implementation was a simple follow camera, but this felt jarring during jumps and fast movement. I refined it to anticipate player direction and smooth out rapid movements, creating a more cinematic and comfortable viewing experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Level design evolved from simple linear stages to more complex layouts with branching paths and hidden areas. Through playtesting with friends and classmates, I identified which challenges felt fair versus frustrating, and adjusted difficulty curves accordingly. I learned that good level design isn't about creating the hardest challenges, but about teaching players mechanics through environmental design and gradually increasing complexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than giving the player multiple attack buttons, I chose to design combat around a single attack input combined with movement. This reduces cognitive load while allowing depth to emerge from timing, positioning, and player intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Different attacks emerge depending on player movement and state. For example, attacking while airborne, standing still, or during movement produces distinct combat outcomes. This encourages players to experiment and utilize dynamic movements to face challenging enemies.
    </p>

    <!-- Reflection -->
    <h3 class="subsection-title">Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      This project taught me far more than just programming—it taught me game design as an iterative, player-focused process. Technically, I gained deep experience with physics systems, camera programming, and the importance of precise numerical tuning in creating responsive gameplay. But more importantly, I learned how to design systems that feel good to interact with, not just function correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I were to approach this project again, I would focus more on prototyping multiple mechanics early before committing to implementation. I spent considerable time building features that ultimately didn't enhance the core experience. I also learned the value of playtesting early and often—watching others play revealed issues I would never have noticed myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The biggest takeaway is understanding that great game design comes from iteration and refinement, not initial brilliance. The difference between a functional platformer and an enjoyable one lies in hundreds of small details—timing windows, animation feedback, level pacing—that only emerge through careful testing and adjustment. This project transformed my understanding of game development from "making things work" to "making things feel right."
