    <!-- One-Sentence Purpose -->
    <p class="project-overview">
      This project studies how procedural structure influences player navigation, confusion, and discovery within maze-like environments.
    </p>

    <!-- Project Components -->
    <h3 class="subsection-title">Project Components</h3>

    <h4>Procedurally Generated Maze</h4>
    <p>
      A maze generation system that produces a new layout each time while guaranteeing a solvable path from start to finish. Although the overall structure varies between runs, each maze maintains consistent rules regarding corridor width, junction frequency, and progression, allowing me to study how structural variation alone affects player experience.
    </p>

    <!-- Player Experience Focus -->
    <h3 class="subsection-title">Player Experience Focus</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>When did players feel lost?</strong> Players became disoriented in long, visually uniform corridors with repeated junction patterns. Without distinctive landmarks, it was difficult to form a mental map of the space, leading to confusion and backtracking.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>When did exploration feel rewarding?</strong> Exploration felt most satisfying when players discovered shortcuts, optional dead ends with rewards, or re-encountered familiar areas from new perspectives. These moments created a sense of spatial understanding and mastery.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What made layouts readable vs frustrating?</strong> Readable mazes featured varied corridor lengths, distinct junction structures, and recognizable sub-areas. Frustrating layouts felt homogeneous, making navigation feel random rather than skill-based. Environmental variety was the key factor supporting spatial memory.
    </p>

    <!-- Iteration & Design Focus -->
    <h3 class="subsection-title">Iteration & Design Focus</h3>
    <p>
      Early versions of the generator produced mazes that were technically valid but difficult to navigate. Through playtesting, I observed that excessive uniformity caused players to feel lost quickly, even when the correct path was nearby.
    </p>
    <p>
      In response, I adjusted the generation rules to introduce structural variation, such as longer straight corridors, recognizable junction patterns, and occasional open spaces. These changes did not reduce maze complexity, but they significantly improved readability by giving players visual cues to anchor their spatial understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      This process reinforced the idea that procedural generation is not just about randomness, but about shaping randomness to support player comprehension.
    </p>

    <!-- Design Takeaway -->
    <h3 class="subsection-title">Design Takeaway</h3>
    <p>
      This project influenced how I approach level design in my platformer, particularly in guiding players without explicit instruction. I learned that spatial clarity comes from memorable structure and environmental variation, not from simplifying layouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my platformer levels, I apply these principles by creating visually distinct areas, using environmental cues to hint at optional paths, and ensuring players can gradually build a mental map of the space. The goal is to let players feel clever for navigating the environment, rather than feeling lost or overly guided.
