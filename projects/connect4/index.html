    <!-- One-Sentence Purpose -->
    <p class="project-overview">
      This project explores how different decision-making systems influence gameplay behavior, challenge, and perceived fairness.
    </p>

    <!-- Project Components -->
    <h3 class="subsection-title">Project Components</h3>

    <h4>Connect 4</h4>
    <p>
     A classic two-player connection game in which players take turns dropping discs into a vertical grid. The objective is to align four discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This familiar rule set provides a controlled environment for comparing different AI decision-making approaches without introducing mechanical complexity.
    </p>

    <h4>Minimax AI</h4>
    <p>
      A rule-based decision system grounded in game theory, designed to select mathematically optimal moves. Using alpha-beta pruning to evaluate future game states efficiently, the Minimax AI produces consistent and predictable behavior, serving as a baseline for “perfect play.”
    </p>

    <h4>NEAT AI (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)</h4>
    <p>
      An evolutionary approach in which neural networks develop through selection and mutation rather than explicit optimization. Instead of consistently pursuing optimal outcomes, the NEAT agent evolves varied behaviors through trial and error, resulting in play styles that are less predictable and occasionally sub-optimal.
    </p>

    <!-- Design Insight -->
    <h3 class="subsection-title">Design Insight</h3>
    <p>
      Playing against the Minimax AI felt like competing against a flawless but mechanical opponent. Its decisions were always optimal, leading to highly consistent match patterns. While technically impressive, this predictability reduced long-term engagement, as players could quickly anticipate its responses.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast, the NEAT AI exhibited more organic behavior. It occasionally made unexpected or inefficient moves, sometimes creating opportunities for recovery or sudden shifts in momentum. These imperfections introduced uncertainty and tension, making each match feel distinct and emotionally engaging.
    </p>
    <p>
      This comparison revealed an important insight: optimal play does not necessarily produce the most engaging experience. NEAT’s inconsistencies created moments of surprise and relief that made victories feel more personal and meaningful. In this context, imperfection enhanced playability rather than diminishing it.
    </p>

    <!-- Design Takeaway -->
    <h3 class="subsection-title">Design Takeaway</h3>
    <p>
      This project significantly influenced how I approach enemy behavior and challenge design in my platformer project. Rather than scripting enemies to always act optimally, I focus on creating behaviors that feel readable, fair, and intentionally imperfect. Small moments of hesitation or error make opponents feel more alive and give players room to learn and improve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The objective is not to create the most punishing challenge, but to design encounters that feel satisfying to overcome—where success feels earned through understanding and skill, not memorization or exploitation.
    </p>
